Preprocessor utilities to generate indexed repetitions, for codegen & etc.  
The maximum repetition count is 2^16 = 65536; a 4 hex-digit index limit.

----

```c++
// IREPEAT_example.hpp
#include "IREPEAT.hpp"
IREPEAT((f)(f),HEXLIT,COMMA) // Generate 256 values 0-255
#include "IREPEAT_UNDEF.hpp"
```

<details><summary><b>Preprocess</b>: e.g. <code>cpp -P -E IREPEAT_example.hpp</code> ...</summary>

The provided `HEXLIT` macro is expanded 256 times to a comma-separated list  
of hexadecimal literals, ranging from `0x00` to `0xff` inclusive. The double-digit  
output reflects the number of digits in the specified end index `(f)(f)`:

```cpp
0x00,0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08,0x09,0x0a,0x0b,...
 ... 0xf5,0xf6,0xf7,0xf8,0xf9,0xfa,0xfb,0xfc,0xfd,0xfe,0xff
```

</details>

### **`IREPEAT.hpp`**: Horizontal repetition

<details><summary>Macro expansion is '<b>horizontal</b>'; replacements are made within a single line.</summary>

Indexed-repeat macros expand to a single long line of separated repetitions:

```cpp
IREPEAT(N,M,S) -> M((0)) S() M((1)) S() ... M(N-1) S() M(N)
XREPEAT(N,M,S) -> M((0)) S() ... M(N-2) S() M(N-1)
```

**I** for **I**nclusive: **M(H)** is repeated **N+1** times for **H** in range **[0,N]**  
**X** for e**X**clusive: **M(H)** is repeated **N** times for **H** in range **[0,N)**

* **N** is the number of **XREPEAT**s. The number of **IREPEAT**s is **N + 1**.
* **M** is a macro, or tokens, parameterized by HEXS repeat-index H.
* **S** is a separator-generator argument, i.e. **S()** expands to a separator.

Number **N** (the provided 'cardinal') and its generated repeat-indices **H**... ('ordinals')  
are represented as 'HEXS'; parenthesized sequences of hex digits:

```cpp
 XREPEAT((0)(3),X,COLON); -> X((0)(0));X((0)(1));X((0)(2));
 XREPEAT((0)(0),X,COLON); -> ; // caution; 0-length XREPEAT
```

Note that generated indices have the same number of digits as their cardinal **N**.  
Beware of vanishing zero-length XREPEAT; use IREPEAT, I repeat, use IREPEAT.

### **`VREPEAT.hpp`**: Vertical repetition

<details><summary>'<b>Vertical</b>' repetition expands each rep on its own line by repeated <code>#include</code></summary>

```cpp
#include "IREPEAT.hpp"
#define VREPEAT_COUNT (f)(f)
#define VREPEAT_MACRO Iteration HEXLIT
#define VREPEAT_SEPARATOR COMMA
#include "VREPEAT.hpp"
#include "IREPEAT_UNDEF.hpp"
```

Preprocesses to:

```cpp
Iteration 0x00,
Iteration 0x01,
  ...
Iteration 0xfe,
Iteration 0xff
```

`VREPEAT_MACRO` is expanded as either:

1. `VREPEAT_MACRO(VREPEAT_INDEX)`

  * `VREPEAT_SEPARATOR()` is appended, if defined,  
  on all but the final repeat `NREPEAT == NREPEATS`

2. `#include STR(VREPEAT_MACRO)`

  * Used if stringized `VREPEAT_MACRO` is the name of an include file  
as detected by `__has_include__(STR(VREPEAT_MACRO))`

The following preprocessor names are set automatically:

* `VREPEAT_INDEX`: The repeat index digits in HEXS format
* `C3`,`C2`,`C1`,`C0`: Individual hex digits of `VREPEAT_COUNT`
* `D3`,`D2`,`D1`,`D0`: Individual hex digits of `VREPEAT_INDEX`
* `NREPEAT`: The repeat index as an integer literal
* `NREPEATS`: `VREPEAT_COUNT` as an integer literal

</details>

----

### **`HEXS`**: hexadecimal digit sequences

<details><summary><b>Numbers</b> are represented as hex digit sequences, e.g. <code>(1)(f) == 0x1f == 31</code></summary>

The HEXS representation here has up to 4 parenthesized hexadecimal digits:

```cpp
HEXS = (h0) | (h1)(h0) | (h2)(h1)(h0) | (h3)(h2)(h1)(h0)
```

The hex letter-digits are required to be lowercase only.

Four digits is a practical repeat-count limit; 2^16 reps take ~1s and ~1Gbyte.

Props to pre-pro pioneers, particularly Paul Mensonides.  
Don't forget to `#undef` your `#define`'s.
